*    Purpose : Given  two  files  containing  total  polarization
*              and polarization angle , then two files containing
*              the Stokes parameters Q and U are generated .
*
*    Usage   : The filenames  of the files  containing the total
*              polarization  and  polarization  angle  data  are
*              prompted for  .  A filename  and a title  is then
*              requested  for each of  the files to  contain the
